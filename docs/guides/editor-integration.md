# Editor integration

The ADK extension schema is available at
[`docs/schema/agent-characteristics.json`](../schema/agent-characteristics.json).
It describes the `metadata.adk` container used for task-level agent/self-heal
config and document-level model/provider/memory registries.

For VS Code, associate workflow documents with the vendored OpenWorkflow schema
and the extension schema in a JSON/YAML schema extension or workspace settings.
The repository includes a small starter snippet under `.vscode/openworkflow.code-snippets`.
