# ADR 0008: Extended workflow flavor

## Status

Superseded — catalog mode removed, extended mode remains the sole flavor.

## Historical decision

The project originally supported two intentionally separate authoring flavors:

- **Extended mode** allows ADK agent configuration through
  `task.metadata.adk.agent` and compiles agent tasks directly to Google ADK
  agents.
- **Catalog mode** kept workflow documents spec-pure and resolved named
  functions from a reusable external catalog file referenced by
  `use.catalogs.<name>.functions`.

Catalog mode was removed to simplify the project around a single extended
flavor. The `metadata.adk` encoding continues to be valid OpenWorkflow v1.0.3:
other implementors can parse the same documents and ignore the ADK metadata.

## Consequences

- Only extended mode is documented, tested, and exposed in the CLI/API.
- `use.catalogs` is still permitted by the upstream OpenWorkflow schema but is
  ignored by this translator.
- Shared reusable functions should be placed in `use.functions` or exposed as
  agent tools.
