# Conformance review request: open-workflow-agent-adk

This implementation requests guidance from the Open Workflow Specification
maintainers on entering the CTK/conformance review process.

Evidence available in this repository:

- vendored OpenWorkflow 1.0.3 schema validation;
- deterministic task, control-flow, event, and error handling tests;
- round-trip portability and Temporal/importer checks;
- full automated suite passing with the extension isolated from base-schema
  validation;
- security, persistence/resume, broker, and agent-team acceptance coverage.

Requested maintainer feedback:

1. Which current CTK feature files are mandatory for a Python runtime
   implementation?
2. What adapter contract should map the Gherkin execution/assertion steps to
   this runtime's event and state model?
3. What evidence and review sequence is required before a conformance claim or
   CNCF project listing is appropriate?
